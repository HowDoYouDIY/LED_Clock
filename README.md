# LED_Clock
This code doesn't keep perfect time. In order to do that you will need an Arduino with either a Real-Time-Clock or a Wifi connection and code to work with those. But this code is functional and a good starting point. I am currently experimenting with these other options and I'll update this GitHub when I have those ready.
